### Introduction
#### Studying the julia set and to a smaller degree mandelbrot set has been captivating.  The complexity and precision of these fractals are quite intriguing and I have enjoyed learning to code using these examples as a medium.

### <u>Julia Set</u>
#### juliaset_.26_.0015.jpg - This is a plot for the julia set given by .26 + .0015i.  I enjoyed the soft edges of the spirals in this plot.
#### juliaset_.26_.0015_zoom.jpg - Here I zoomed in on one of the spirals.  With high resolution, you can see the smooth intricate patterns as they erupt from the center.  They almost appear tentacle-like.
#### juliaset_-.4_.6.jpg - This is a plot for the julia set given by -.4 + .6i.  I found it interesting for the complexity of the pattern.  In particular, I find the 'twist' as the pattern emerges from the center to be intriguing. 
#### juliaset_-.4_.6_zoom.jpg - Here is a closer look at the same julia set plot.  The subject area was 0 to .5 and -5 to 0.

### <u>Mandelbrot Set</u>
#### mandelbrot.jpg - This is a plot of the mandelbrot set.
#### mandelbrot_zoom.jpg - Here I zoomed in on the uppermost arm with a focus on the "lightning bolts" that appear to be pertruding from the edges.
#### mandelbrot_super_zoom.jpg - This is an even closer look at the top most edge.
